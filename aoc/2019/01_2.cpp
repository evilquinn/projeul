/**
 * So, for each module mass, calculate its fuel and add it to the total. Then, treat the fuel amount you just calculated as
 * the input mass and repeat the process, continuing until a fuel requirement is zero or negative. For example:
 *
 * A module of mass 14 requires 2 fuel. This fuel requires no further fuel (2 divided by 3 and rounded down is 0,
 * which would call for a negative fuel), so the total fuel required is still just 2.
 *
 * At first, a module of mass 1969 requires 654 fuel. Then, this fuel requires 216 more fuel (654 / 3 - 2).
 * 216 then requires 70 more fuel, which requires 21 fuel, which requires 5 fuel, which requires no further fuel.
 * So, the total fuel required for a module of mass 1969 is 654 + 216 + 70 + 21 + 5 = 966.
 *
 * The fuel required by a module of mass 100756 and its fuel is: 33583 + 11192 + 3728 + 1240 + 411 + 135 + 43 + 12 + 2 = 50346.
 * What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft when also taking into account the mass
 * of the added fuel? (Calculate the fuel requirements for each module separately, then add them all up at the end.)
